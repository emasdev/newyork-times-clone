              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
              appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
              equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some
              exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang.
              Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
              begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
              evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
              that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
              faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
              instant.
            </p>
            <p>
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
              the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a
              jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all
              the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not
              missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
              ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
              page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
              reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
              that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
              right.
            </p>

            <p>
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to
              <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes
              at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of
              the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples
              in the fabric of space-time — so-called
              <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a
              universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a
              trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They
              are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
              Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
              though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever
              be proved.
            </p>
            <p>
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
              science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
              pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would
              open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
              speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
              extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
              billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
              cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless
              number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a
              pot of pasta water boiling over.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-title">‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>
            <p>
              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
              operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
              accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity
              itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
              observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
              Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
              space-time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
              expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
              as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
              sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
              bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
              picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
              as the surface of the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known
              as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
              Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
              the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of
              papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

        <h3 class="article-title">The Theory of Inflation</h3>
        <p>
          Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
          which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
          in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                <strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong>is just under 14 billion years
                old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe
                a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But
                there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even
                temperature.

                <strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old enough for light
                to have traveled the vast
                distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not
                been enough time for scattered
                patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.

                <strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine using a
                telescope to look a mile in one
                direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can
                estimate its temperature and how
                much it has cooled.

                <strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and look a mile in the
                other direction. You see a
                similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe.
                But if you see a similar cup in
                every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.

              <p>
                <strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been enough time to
                carry coffee cups from place to
                place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled
                from a single coffee pot, all
                at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.

              <p>
                <strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory proposes that,
                less than a trillionth of a
                second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of
                light. Tiny ripples in the
                violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale
                structures of the universe.

              <p>
                <strong>FLUCTUATION</strong> Astronomers have now detected evidence of
                these ancient fluctuations in
                swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is
                energy left over from the early
                universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

              <p>
                <strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single,
                central pot expanding faster than
                light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something
                like inflation. And the
                structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

              Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only
              one in 10 million.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he
              had not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>
              “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we
              have been lucky.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’
              worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of
              a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a
              select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who
              was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
              scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as
              he tended his radio telescopes.

              Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first
              described the most popular variant of inflation, known as
              chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the

              Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had

            <p>
              &ldquo;And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that

              anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30

            <p>
              Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said

              By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that
              inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists
              responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.

              &ldquo;I think the results are beautiful and very

              eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about
              inflation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized
              the need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded
              earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic
              background by the European Space Agency&rsquo;s Planck satellite
              and other assumptions about the universe.
            </p>

            <p>
              &ldquo;So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and
              down,&rdquo; Dr. Krauss said.
            </p>

            <p>
              Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
              will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other
              teams are trying similar measurements from balloons,
              mountaintops and space.

            <p>
              Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of
              the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by
              Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They
              won the Nobel Prize.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of
              these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has
              operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at
              the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing
              conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of
              Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology
              and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
            </p>

            <p>
              “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be
              on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he
              said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he
              said.

              In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the
              microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a
              slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than
              another.
            </p>

            <p>
              This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
              gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space
              in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by,
              would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves,
              theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky
              should have little arrows going in spirals.
            </p>

            <p>
              Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
              differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
              telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
              thermometer.
            </p>

            <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>

            <p>
              The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they
              spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making
              sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might
              beat them to the breakthrough.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article-title">A Special Time</h3>
            <p>
              The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
              like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years
              ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
              universe.
            </p>
            <p>
              Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
              gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces.
              But they have long suspected that those are simply different
              manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe
              in its earliest, hottest moments.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a
              fall from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or
              brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics
              evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
            </p>
            <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
            <p>
              Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as
              the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed,
              at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified
              state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued
              with a mysterious latent energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act
              as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up.
              Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the
              more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
            </p>
            <p>
              What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at
              least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
              primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a
              cosmic eye-blink.
            </p>
            <p>
              Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into
              ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history
              was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a
              patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s
              often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr.
              Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free
              lunch.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models
              resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that
              inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe
              settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the
              cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles
              endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.
            </p>
            <p>
              So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do
              not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
            </p>
            <p>
              We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
              beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before
              it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are
              swept away, forever out of our view.
            </p>
            <p>
              “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
              Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team,
              “you wind up at inflation.”
